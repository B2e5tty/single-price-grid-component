## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned
I have learned how to use Flexbox since i haven't worked on it. I got more familiar working in responsive website.

### Continued development
I still didn't know if we have to design not only for width but for height too. It was confusing how to manage the height cause it has bug in the desktop verions when the height increases. 

### Useful resources
